### Hi there 👋

My name is Jacopo and I’m a design lead with more then 15 years of experience working on digital products.

I mainly deal with user experience and the design strategy for the clients I work with.
My main skills include the Human Centered Design approach and Design Thinking methodologies.

Over the years I have been able to build a toolbox that includes:

- 👉 Design Strategy
- 👉 User Research
- 👉 Usability Testing
- 👉 Interaction Design
- 👉 Design System
- 👉 Prototyping

The clients and partner I work with through the years come from the most varied industries as manufacturing, fintech, insurtech, hospitality and media.
